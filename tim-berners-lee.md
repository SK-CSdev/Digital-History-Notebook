Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 while he was working at CERN.
He created HTML, HTTP, and the first web browser and web server. He intended to make a system that
allowed researchers to easily access information. Since he made his invention publicly available,
it allowed the internet to grow very quickly.
